# Bitcoin Bank: The Lightning-Native Bank Built on Nostr

> **Open. Instant. Transparent. Yours.**

---

## The Problem with Money in 2026

The global banking system was built for a different era. ACH transfers take 1–3 business days. Card networks charge merchants 1.5–3.5% on every transaction. Identity is siloed across thousands of institutions, each holding a private copy of your financial history. And your savings earn nothing — or worse, lose value to inflation while your bank earns interest on your deposits.

Crypto promised a way out, but most crypto wallets just gave you a new problem: technical complexity, no banking features, and no way to actually spend your assets in the real world.

Bitcoin Bank is built on a simple premise: money should move at the speed of information, identity should belong to you, and savings should work for you — not for your bank.

## What Is Bitcoin Bank?

Bitcoin Bank is a full-featured banking platform built natively on the Bitcoin Lightning Network and the Nostr protocol. It combines the instant, low-cost payments of Lightning with the open, decentralized identity of Nostr — and wraps them in a banking experience that consumers and merchants already understand.

There are two sides to the product:

- **For consumers**: a Bitcoin-native bank account with deposits, savings, transfers, withdrawals, and a debit card — all accessible from any Nostr-compatible wallet.
- **For businesses**: a Lightning-powered point-of-sale terminal integrated with Strike for instant settlement, no chargebacks, and near-zero fees.

Both are connected by open protocols. No email addresses. No passwords. No permission required.

## The Consumer Product

### Deposit Instantly, From Anywhere

Any Lightning wallet in the world can deposit into a Bitcoin Bank account using the LNURL-pay standard (LUD-16). Deposits are cryptographically bound to Nostr Zap Requests (NIP-57), meaning every deposit comes with a verifiable, tamper-proof receipt published to Nostr relays. Your bank account becomes auditable by anyone, not just your bank.

There are no minimums beyond 1 satoshi (0.001 msat). There are no wire fees, no ACH holds, no "processing" windows. Settlement is instant.

### Save and Earn Yield

Bitcoin Bank separates your balance into two buckets: spendable and savings. Move funds into savings with a single signed transaction, and they begin earning yield — sourced from Lightning Network routing fees generated by the bank's node. This is real yield from real economic activity, not a manufactured APY funded by new deposits.

As the bank's Lightning node routes payments across the network, it earns routing fees. Those fees are distributed pro-rata to savers every day. The more savers, the more liquidity, the more routing volume — a natural flywheel.

### Transfer to Anyone on Nostr

Send funds to any Nostr user by their `npub` (public key). Transfers are instant, free within the bank, and recorded as Nostr Kind 33194 events — signed by the sender and verified by the bank. No account numbers. No routing codes. No intermediaries.

### Withdraw via Lightning

Withdraw to any Lightning invoice or Lightning Address (`user@domain`) in seconds. The bank verifies your Nostr-signed challenge before authorizing any outbound payment, ensuring only the account owner can move funds. Support for Nostr Wallet Connect (NWC) means you can authorize withdrawals directly from Zeus, Phoenix, or any NWC-compatible mobile wallet — no web interface required.

### The Bitcoin Debit Card

Bitcoin Bank includes a debit card powered by Brahma Console on Base (Ethereum L2). Top up your card by converting spendable satoshis to USDC at the prevailing BTC/USD rate. The USDC is held in a smart contract deployed specifically for your account — no shared custodian pool. Spend anywhere USDC is accepted.

This is Bitcoin-backed spending without selling your Bitcoin. The conversion happens at point-of-spend, not at point-of-deposit.

## The Business Product

### Lightning Point of Sale

Merchants connect their Strike account to Bitcoin Bank via OAuth 2.0. The Strike Connect model gives the bank persistent, delegated access to generate invoices, execute trades, and settle payments on the merchant's behalf — without storing credentials.

The POS interface is intentionally simple: a numeric keypad, a large amount display, and a payment button. Enter the sale amount, press Pay, and a Lightning invoice QR code appears. The customer scans with any Lightning wallet and pays. Settlement is confirmed in seconds.

No card reader. No network downtime. No interchange fees. No chargebacks — ever.

### Real-Time Settlement Dashboard

The merchant dashboard shows live balances in both USD and Bitcoin, a running sales history, and transaction status in real time. Strike handles the fiat conversion on the backend, so merchants can choose to hold Bitcoin or settle to USD instantly via FedNow/RTP.

### Why Lightning for Merchants?

Lightning payments are final. There is no dispute process because there is nothing to dispute — the payment either happened or it didn't, and both parties can verify it cryptographically. This eliminates the $120B per year in chargeback fraud that plagues card-accepting merchants.

Lightning fees are measured in fractions of a cent, not percentages. A $100 sale costs roughly $0.001 in routing fees — versus $2.50–$3.50 on a standard card terminal.

## The Protocol

Bitcoin Bank is not a product built on proprietary infrastructure. It is an implementation of open, interoperable protocols that existed before this bank and will exist after it.

### Lightning Network (BOLT Standards)

The value layer. All deposits and withdrawals travel over Lightning. The LNURL-pay standard (LUD-16) enables any compatible wallet to interact with the bank's deposit endpoint at `/.well-known/lnurlp/bank` — a standard URL discoverable like email. The bank advertises `allowsNostr: true`, enabling NIP-57 Zap compatibility.

### Nostr (NIPs 07, 47, 57, Kind 30078)

The identity and state layer. Nostr replaces email/password authentication entirely. Every user is identified by a cryptographic public key (`npub`). Every sensitive action — withdrawal, transfer, savings change — requires a Nostr-signed challenge response. No account can be accessed without possession of the private key.

Beyond authentication, Nostr serves as a transparency layer. After every balance change, the bank publishes a Kind 30078 event — a parameterized replaceable event containing the account's current balance, savings, APY, and recent transactions. This event is signed by the bank's Nostr key and broadcast to public relays. Any Nostr client can subscribe to your balance updates. Your financial state is not locked in a private database — it is published, verifiable, and portable.

**Kind 30078 balance event structure:**
```json
{
  "kind": 30078,
  "tags": [["d", "bank/balance/<pubkey>"]],
  "content": {
    "balance_msats": 150000000,
    "savings_msats": 50000000,
    "savings_apy": 2.4,
    "recent_transactions": [...]
  }
}
```

### Nostr Wallet Connect (NIP-47)

NWC enables wallet apps like Zeus and Phoenix to interact with Bitcoin Bank directly over Nostr relays, without a web browser. Users generate a `nostr+walletconnect://` URI, scan it in their mobile wallet, and gain the ability to make withdrawals from their phone — signed by their Nostr key, authorized by the bank, settled over Lightning.

This is the beginning of a universal wallet protocol: any NWC-compatible wallet becomes a Bitcoin Bank client.

### Strike API

The fiat bridge. Strike's OAuth 2.0 Connect model gives Bitcoin Bank delegated access to merchants' Strike accounts — the same model used by fintech giants like Plaid. This enables quote generation, trade execution, and Lightning payment initiation on behalf of the merchant, without ever storing credentials.

### Brahma Console (Base L2)

The spending layer. Each cardholder gets a smart contract account on Base (Ethereum L2), deployed specifically for them. BTC-to-USDC conversions are credited to this contract. Spending debits the contract. The architecture is non-custodial at the card level — the bank holds Bitcoin, but USDC on Base is held in the user's own smart contract address.

## Why This Is Different

| | Traditional Bank | Crypto Wallet | Bitcoin Bank |
|---|---|---|---|
| Settlement speed | 1–3 business days | Varies (on-chain: 10 min+) | Instant |
| Fees | 1.5–3.5% (merchant) | Gas fees vary | Near-zero |
| Identity | Email + password + KYC | Private key only | Nostr public key |
| Savings yield | 0.01–0.5% APY (bank keeps rest) | None | Routing fees (variable, real) |
| State transparency | Private | On-chain (public ledger) | Nostr (queryable, human-readable) |
| Wallet interoperability | None | Limited | NWC (open standard) |
| Debit card | Yes (fiat) | Rare, complex | Yes (BTC-backed USDC) |
| Business POS | Yes (high fees) | No | Yes (Lightning, near-zero fees) |
| Chargebacks | Yes (costly) | No | No |

The core differentiator is not any single feature — it is the combination of an open identity layer (Nostr), an open value layer (Lightning), and banking features that people already need. Bitcoin Bank is not asking users to change their behavior. It is giving them better infrastructure for the same behavior.

## What's Next

Bitcoin Bank is built on composable open protocols. The roadmap follows the natural extension of those protocols:

**Near-term:**
- NWC expansion: support `get_balance`, `list_transactions` alongside `pay_invoice`
- Custom Nostr relay (Khatru) for lower-latency balance sync
- LSP integration (Greenlight + Breez) for zero-conf inbound channels — any new user can receive instantly

**Medium-term:**
- On-chain bridge: deposit directly from a Bitcoin address (not just Lightning)
- Multi-currency savings: earn yield in sats, display in local currency
- Merchant invoicing: recurring Lightning invoices for subscriptions

**Long-term:**
- Federated bank model: multiple operators running compatible instances, users portable between banks
- NIP-60 Cashu integration: offline-capable ecash wallets
- Full NWC suite: budget controls, spending policies, multi-device
